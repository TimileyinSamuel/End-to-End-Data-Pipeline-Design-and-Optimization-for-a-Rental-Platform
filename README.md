### Designing a Scalable Data Pipeline and Analytics Framework for a Rental Platform Using dbt and Snowflake

In the rapidly growing short-term rental industry, data plays a critical role in driving strategic decisions, from optimizing pricing and maximizing occupancy to enhancing customer experience and streamlining operations. However, raw data sourced from various operational systems is often fragmented, inconsistent, and difficult to analyze in its original form.

This project focuses on building a reliable, scalable, and analytics-ready data infrastructure for a rental platform. The objective was to transform disparate datasets (such as property listings, bookings, customer activity, reviews, and external factors) into a clean and well-structured data model that supports high-quality business analysis.

Using data tools like Google Cloud Storage for ingestion, Snowflake for warehousing, and dbt for modeling and transformation, the project delivers a centralized analytics environment powered by a modular star schema. Final outputs include curated data marts designed to provide insights into customer behavior, revenue trends, operational performance, and pricing optimization.

This project emphasizes thoughtful architecture, rigorous testing, and documentation, all designed to ensure data trust, usability, and scalability for decision-makers across the business.
